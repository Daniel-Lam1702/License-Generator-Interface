# License-Generator-Interface
# This project was completely developed in Python when I was in Costa Rica during a semester in college. The interface was created with the library Tkinter.
# I created with another student a driver's license system that contains an internal "database" (binary file) that stores the drivers.
# It contains the functions of:
# Creating the XML that collects the criteria to generate the types of driving licenses with web scraping.
# -Creates licenses randomly according to the number of licenses the user requests to create.
# -Renew Licenses: Requests the user the id of the driver to renew its expiration date
# -Generates with the id a pdf of the license.
# -Generates an Excel report depending on the criterion set by the user.
# This project simulates a REST app on a low scale.
